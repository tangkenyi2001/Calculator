# Calculator
A simple calculator built with React.js for the frontend and Node.js (Express) for the backend. This calculator supports basic addition and subtraction functions. When a user inputs two numbers and selects either Add or Subtract, a POST request is sent to the backend, where the calculation is processed and the result is returned to the frontend for display.

## Features
Addition and Subtraction operations
User-friendly interface built with React.js and Chakra UI
Backend API built with Node.js (Express) to handle calculations
Responsive UI that updates with the calculation result

## Useful scripts

npm start
```

```
