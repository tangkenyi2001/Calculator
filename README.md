# Calculator
A simple calculator built with React.js for the frontend and Node.js (Express) for the backend. This calculator supports basic addition and subtraction functions. When a user inputs two numbers and selects either Add or Subtract, a POST request with application/x-www-form-urlencoded content type is sent to the backend REST API. The backend processes the calculation and returns the result as application/json, which is then displayed on the frontend.
## Features
Addition and Subtraction operations
User-friendly interface built with React.js and Chakra UI
Backend API built with Node.js (Express) to handle calculations
Responsive UI that updates with the calculation result
